Born in 1981 in Kitzb√ºhel (Tirol - Austria) I grew up in the middle of the beautiful alps. After finishing basic school I decided to attend a higher technical school in Saalfelden (Salzbug - Austria) with a focus on electrical engineering which I finished in 2001.

In October 2002 I started my bachelor degree course (_computer and media security_) in Hagenberg (Upper Austria - Austria). During this time I've fell in love with Linux and open source. I've also learned much about programming (C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP) and networks in this time - which is a good addition to Linux ;). In July 2005 I've finished my bachelors degree.

After finishing my bachelors degree I started with my masters degree (_secure information systems_) in October 2005 (Hagenberg). In the last semester I wrote my thesis about _detecting virtual machine based rootkits_. Side by side with writing my thesis I worked at the KPMG in Linz (Upper Austria - Austria) in the department _forensics_. I finished my masters degree with excellent success in July 2007.

Since August 2007 I work at _FRITZ EGGER GmbH & Co. OG_ in St. Johann in Tirol (Tirol - Austria) as a developer/software architect for SAP systems.
